; PROBLEM:
; 
; Given the following data definition for a binary search tree,
; design a function that consumes a bst and produces a SIMPLE 
; rendering of that bst including lines between nodes and their 
; subnodes.
; 
; To help you get started, we've added some sketches below of 
; one way you could include lines to a bst.


;; Constants

(define TEXT-SIZE  14)
(define TEXT-COLOR "BLACK")

(define KEY-VAL-SEPARATOR ":")

(define MTTREE (rectangle 20 1 "solid" "white"))

;; Data definitions:

(define-struct node (key val l r))
;; A BST (Binary Search Tree) is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - (make-node Integer String BST BST)
;; interp. false means no BST, or empty BST
;;         key is the node key
;;         val is the node val
;;         l and r are left and right subtrees
;; INVARIANT: for a given node:
;;     key is > all keys in its l(eft)  child
;;     key is < all keys in its r(ight) child
;;     the same key never appears twice in the tree

;; Functions:

; 
; Here is a sketch of one way the lines could work. What 
; this sketch does is allows us to see the structure of
; the functions pretty clearly. We'll have one helper for
; the key value image, and one helper to draw the lines.
; Each of those produces a rectangular image of course.
; 
; .
; 
; And here is a sketch of the helper that draws the lines:
; .  
; where lw means width of left subtree image and
;       rw means width of right subtree image
